## Proposal

Our proposed project aims to solve the problem of security and convenience home lock systems. Traditional systems often require physical keys that can be lost or duplicated or one set passcode, which can be easily forgotten or stolen. Our smart lock system with OTP functionality solves this problem by allowing owners to grant access to guests through a one-time password that works only during a specific time frame, ensuring security and convenience. The system also has the option of generating a random passcode and sending it to the owner every set period of time. Additionally, the system has a feature of taking a picture if someone entered the password more than a set number of times and sending it to the owner. Our proposed solution provides a reliable and user-friendly alternative to traditional lock systems.
